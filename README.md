# YouTube_Focus

YouTube has one billion hours whatched daily, and itâ€™s recommendation algorithm generates more than 70% of views. That means 700.000.000 hours every single day. What means that the greatest slice of time that people spend on YouTube isnt because they searched for something to whatch or something to learn, it is because they were sugested by YouTube's algorithm.

Algorithm's operation is secret, but some researshers, like Gillaume Chaslot, are claiming that the Youtube's alorithm [drives people to divisive content](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-youtube-drives-viewers-to-the-internets-darkest-corners-1518020478) and promotes [conspirancy theory videos.](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/02/how-youtubes-algorithm-distorts-truth)
